        Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have 
        biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, 
        from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased 
        (they have died), or because they never had such functions and are classified 
        as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as 
        plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. 
        Biology is the science concerned with the study of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life. 
        One popular definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain 
        homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, 
        can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. 
        Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as viruses and viroids.
      </p>

      <p>
        Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, 
        such as simple organic compounds. The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that 
        the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, 
        but a gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared 
        as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, 
        and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. 
        The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria.
        Researchers generally think that current life on Earth descends from an RNA world,
        although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed. 
        The classic 1952 Miller–Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, 
        the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, 
        can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to 
        replicate those of the early Earth. Complex organic molecules occur in the Solar System 
        and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale, 
        but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions. 
        Some microorganisms, called extremophiles, thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments 
        that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life. 
        There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed 
        within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. 
        Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by "life" 
        through obsolete concepts such as odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous generation and vitalism, 
        that have now been disproved by biological discoveries. Aristotle is considered to be the first person to classify organisms. 
        Later, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species. 
        Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, 
        forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. 
        Though currently only known on Earth, life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of extraterrestrial life. 
        Artificial life is a computer simulation or human-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism, 
        and as such, is the end of its life. Extinction is the term describing the dying out of a group or taxon, 
        usually a species. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.

    <header>Definitions</header>
    <article>
      <p>The definition of life has long been a challenge for scientists and philosophers, 
        with many varied definitions put forward.[16][17][18] This is partially because life is a process, 
        not a substance. This is complicated by a lack of knowledge of the characteristics of living entities, 
        if any, that may have developed outside of Earth. Philosophical definitions of life have also been put forward, 
        with similar difficulties on how to distinguish living things from the non-living. 
        Legal definitions of life have also been described and debated, though these generally focus on 
        the decision to declare a human dead, and the legal ramifications of this decision.
      </p>

      <header>Biology</header>
      <p> Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, most current definitions in biology are descriptive. 
        Life is considered a characteristic of something that preserves, 
        furthers or reinforces its existence in the given environment. 
        This characteristic exhibits all or most of the following traits:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Homeostasis</strong>: regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organization</strong>: being structurally composed of one or more cells – the basic units of life
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Metabolism</strong>: transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components (anabolism) and decomposing organic matter (catabolism). Living things require energy to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Growth</strong>: maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptation</strong>: the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of evolution and is determined by the organism's heredity, diet, and external factors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Response to Stimuli</strong>: a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reproduction</strong>: the ability to produce new individual organisms, either asexually from a single parent organism or sexually from two parent organisms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img id="img-life-characteristics" src="assets/Characteristics_of_life.svg" alt="Characteristics of Life">

      <p> These complex processes, called physiological functions, have underlying physical and chemical bases, 
        as well as signaling and control mechanisms that are essential to maintaining life.
      </p>

      <header>Alternative definitions</header>
      <p>From a physics perspective, living beings are thermodynamic systems with an organized molecular structure that can reproduce itself and evolve as survival dictates.[32][33] Thermodynamically, life has been described as an open system which makes use of gradients in its surroundings to create imperfect copies of itself.[34] Hence, life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.[35][36] A major strength of this definition is that it distinguishes life by the evolutionary process rather than its chemical composition.[37]
      </p>
      <p>Others take a systemic viewpoint that does not necessarily depend on molecular chemistry. One systemic definition of life is that living things are self-organizing and autopoietic (self-producing). Variations of this definition include Stuart Kauffman's definition as an autonomous agent or a multi-agent system capable of reproducing itself or themselves, and of completing at least one thermodynamic work cycle.[38] This definition is extended by the apparition of novel functions over time.[39]
      </p>

      <header>Viruses</header>
      <p>Whether or not viruses should be considered as alive is controversial. They are most often considered as just replicators rather than forms of life.[40] They have been described as "organisms at the edge of life"[41] because they possess genes, evolve by natural selection,[42][43] and replicate by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly. However, viruses do not metabolize and they require a host cell to make new products. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it may support the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.[44][45][46]
      </p>

      <header>Biophysics</header>
      <p>To reflect the minimum phenomena required, other biological definitions of life have been proposed,[47] with many of these being based upon chemical systems. Biophysicists have commented that living things function on negative entropy.[48][49] In other words, living processes can be viewed as a delay of the spontaneous diffusion or dispersion of the internal energy of biological molecules towards more potential microstates.[16] In more detail, according to physicists such as John Bernal, Erwin Schrödinger, Eugene Wigner, and John Avery, life is a member of the class of phenomena that are open or continuous systems able to decrease their internal entropy at the expense of substances or free energy taken in from the environment and subsequently rejected in a degraded form.[50][51]
      </p>

      <header>Living systems theories</header>
      <p>Living systems are open self-organizing living things that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, energy, and matter.
      </p>
      <p>Budisa, Kubyshkin and Schmidt defined cellular life as an organizational unit resting on four pillars/cornerstones: (i) energy, (ii) metabolism, (iii) information and (iv) form. This system is able to regulate and control metabolism and energy supply and contains at least one subsystem that functions as an information carrier (genetic information). Cells as self-sustaining units are parts of different populations that are involved in the unidirectional and irreversible open-ended process known as evolution.[52]
      </p>
      <p>Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of life.[53] Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and biological sciences and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.[54]
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gaia hypothesis</strong>: The idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist James Hutton. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be physiology. Hutton is considered the father of geology, but his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense reductionism of the 19th century.[55]:10 The Gaia hypothesis, proposed in the 1960s by scientist James Lovelock,[56][57] suggests that life on Earth functions as a single organism that defines and maintains environmental conditions necessary for its survival.[55] This hypothesis served as one of the foundations of the modern Earth system science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nonfractionability</strong>: The first attempt at a general living systems theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist James Grier Miller.[58] Robert Rosen (1991) built on this by defining a system component as "a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole." From this and other starting concepts, he developed a "relational theory of systems" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the "nonfractionability of components in an organism" as the fundamental difference between living systems and "biological machines."[59]
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Life as a property of ecosystems</strong>: A systems view of life treats environmental fluxes and biological fluxes together as a "reciprocity of influence,"[60] and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As Harold J. Morowitz (1992) explains it, life is a property of an ecological system rather than a single organism or species.[61] He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly biochemical or physical one. Robert Ulanowicz (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.[62]
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex systems biology</strong>: Complex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of dynamic systems theory.[63] The latter is also often called systems biology and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a category theory of biological relations, as well as an algebraic topology of the functional organization of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex networks of metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic processes and signaling pathways.[64][65] Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.[66]
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Darwinian dynamic</strong>: It has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic.[67][68] The Darwinian dynamic was formulated by first considering how macroscopic order is generated in a simple non-biological system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and then extending consideration to short, replicating RNA molecules. The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.[67]
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operator theory</strong>: Another systemic definition called the operator theory proposes that "life is a general term for the presence of the typical closures found in organisms; the typical closures are a membrane and an autocatalytic set in the cell"[69] and that an organism is any system with an organisation that complies with an operator type that is at least as complex as the cell.[70][71][72][73] Life can also be modeled as a network of inferior negative feedbacks of regulatory mechanisms subordinated to a superior positive feedback formed by the potential of expansion and reproduction.[74]

    <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
        in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
        Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
        JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
        class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
        loosely typed methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
        be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
        you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
        function return types are not explicitly typed.

  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>
      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
      names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
      dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
      JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
      "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
      You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
      identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
      _name.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
    <header>Declaring variables</header>
    <article>
      You can declare a variable in three ways:
      <p>
        With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
        below.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header>Variable scope</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
        is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code
        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code
      >
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Global variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
        variables using the window.variable syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
        frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
        name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
        document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
        parent.phoneNumber.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
      </p>

      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
      <p>
        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
        represent a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
        variable in the same scope. For example:
      </p>

      <code
        >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
        }</code
      >
      However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
      is executed without problems.
      <code
        >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code

    <article>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>

        <li>
          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>
              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
              other variant.
            </li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
              unique and immutable.

          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
      your application can perform.

      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
      true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
      is false. An if statement looks as follows:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code
        >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      </code>
      In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
      evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
      them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
      to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

      <code
        >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
      >
      It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
      because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
      the code. For example, do not use the following code:
      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
      assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
      additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
      statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>

      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>

      Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates.

    <header>Function declarations</header>
    <article>
      A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
      statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>
          A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
          separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
          brackets, { }.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
      </p>

      <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
      <p>
        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
        consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
        function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
        specifies the value returned by the function.
      </p>
      <code>return number * number;</code>
      <p>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
        value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
        the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
        the calling function.
